I'm a physics undergraduate who loves using data to solve issues. I have been using Python to simulate and solve physics equations. I got introduced to data science during year 3 and since then, I have studied and, more recently, worked with data science and machine learning algorithms. For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.

### Analytics Tools

* **Data Collection and Storage:** SQL and MySQL

* **Data Processing and Analytics:** Python, R, Jupyter and Spyder.

* **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib.

* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clusterization, and Recommendation.

## Physics Simulation Projects

* ### [Brachistochrone curve](https://github.com/fengqingg/Brachistochrone-curve)

    An analysis of a simplified Brachistochrone problem. First by calculating the time needed to reach x=pi, then solving the ODE using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4). Eventually, optimizing the Brachistochrone equation parameters suchs that the time to reach the bottom of the equation with a mass is the shortest.

## Data Science Projects

* ### [Diabetes Prediction in R](https://github.com/fengqingg/Diabetes-Classification)

    This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and it originated from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The best model was linear SVM with an accuracy of 76% and lowest false positive result. The result was limited by the small sample size of the dataset which introduced high variance in the model.

* ### [Loan Defaulter Prediction](https://github.com/fengqingg/Loan-Prediction)

    This dataset is belongs to a Hackathon organized by "Univ.AI". An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product based on historic customer behavior. Possible defaulters will be with Risk_Flag == 1 and 0 for not possible for being a defaulter. After using several machine learning models and GridSearch, the best model is the random forest classifier with 93.4% accuracy.


## Other Projects

* ### [Pentago Game](https://github.com/fengqingg/Pentago)

    Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Tomas FlodÃ©n. Like chess, pentago is a two player game and the goal of the two players is to make the other player lose (or at least tie). In this notebook, pentago is coded with Python using Numpy with two available game modes, Player versus Player (PVP) mode or Computer bots with two level of difficulty.
