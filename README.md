I am a Data Engineer with a focus on cloud-based data solutions and ETL pipeline development, currently working in the semiconductor industry. I design and manage data workflows that support stakeholders from various module teams, leveraging my foundational knowledge in semiconductor fabrication to troubleshoot and resolve data-related issues.

With experience in parallel processing, automation, and containerization, I aim to create efficient and scalable data solutions. My background in physics enhances my analytical thinking, and Iâ€™m committed to continuously learning and improving my skills in data engineering and cloud technologies. For more details about my projects, please check the data science project section.

## Data Science Projects

* ### [S&P500 Forecast](https://github.com/fengqingg/SANDP500)

    As a beginner investor, I'm always looking for ways to improve my investment strategy and make more informed decisions. Thus, I explored methods that can help me and created two models to predict when to buy and sell stocks. I downloaded historical data of the S&P500 from Kaggle, analyzed trends and seasonality, and used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) followed by ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for forecasting.

* ### [Anime Recommendation System](https://github.com/fengqingg/Anime-Recommendation)

    I enjoy watching anime and developed a recommendation system based on user preferences. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I implemented Content-Based Filtering with TF-IDF vectorization for genre similarity and Collaborative Filtering with Pearson correlation for recommending highly rated animes.

* ### [Diabetes Prediction in R](https://github.com/fengqingg/Diabetes-Classification)

    This project involved a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases aimed at predicting diabetes diagnosis. The best model achieved an accuracy of 76% using linear SVM, limited by the dataset's small sample size.

* ### [Loan Defaulter Prediction](https://github.com/fengqingg/Loan-Prediction)

    This project was part of a hackathon organized by "Univ.AI" to predict potential loan defaulters based on historical customer behavior. The best-performing model was a random forest classifier with 93.4% accuracy.

* ### [Titanic Classification](https://github.com/fengqingg/Titanic)

    In this Kaggle competition, I predicted passenger survival on the Titanic. After learning various feature selection techniques, I achieved a model accuracy of 82.1% and a public score of 76.8%.

## Physics Simulation Projects

* ### [Brachistochrone Curve](https://github.com/fengqingg/Brachistochrone-curve)

    An analysis of a simplified Brachistochrone problem, where I calculated the time to reach a specific point and solved the ODE using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), optimizing parameters for minimal travel time.

* ### [Waste Optimization](https://github.com/fengqingg/Waste-Optimization-Analysis)

    This project optimizes net profit using quadratic interpolation and employs a root bisect method to determine tax amounts for waste management. It also discusses a Newton-Raphson method for approximating the root of the tax function and its limitations.

## Other Projects

* ### [Pentago Game](https://github.com/fengqingg/Pentago)

    Pentago is a two-player abstract strategy board game. This project, coded in Python using Numpy, offers two game modes: Player versus Player (PVP) and Computer bots with varying difficulty levels.
